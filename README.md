```
```bash
pip install scikit-fuzzy
```
```bash
pip install math smbus time
```
```bash 
pip install numpy

```bash
apt-get install rpi.gpio
```
You also have to download a git repo to be able to use the MPUs
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rocheparadox/Kalman-Filter-Python-for-mpu6050.git
```
Now for the installation on the laptop
```bash
pip install scikit-fuzzy
```
```bash
pip install numpy
```
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

# Implementation
To run the code you fisrt have to get the IP address from the pi and replace it in the code running on the laptop. After that you run the code on the pi then you run the code on the laptop and the sorting will start.
Note: you need to place the dnn model in the same directory as your code.
